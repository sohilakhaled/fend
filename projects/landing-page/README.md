## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Index
This file represents the skeleton of the landing page. Within the header, you'll find the navigation outlined. Within the body, there are five sections that are added to begin with. Right now, there is simply filler text here but this can be easily fixed in the future.

## App
Here is where the functionality happens. There is three things that this file primarily achieves. The first is dynamically building out the navigation showing which section is currently "active" in the page. listens for clicks on the navigation and then scrolls the page to the appropriate section header.

## Styles
Most of the code here was taken from the skelton code provided by Udacity. This gives the landing page the look and feel that you see and experience. One notable thing is the hover animation on the active navigation header.

## Running
To launch this website, simply clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in the browser.
